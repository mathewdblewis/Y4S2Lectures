wumpus world:
grid of squares
there are pits and a wumpus
if you touch the wumpus or the pits you die
if you are adjacent (not diagonal) to a pit, you feel breeze
you don't know where the pit is though, just that you are near one
if you are neighbouring the wumpus you smell its stench
you can shoot an arrow in the direction you are facing
you start in the start square and must return to it to end the game
each use of an arrow costs 10 points, each action costs 1 point
falling in a pit or being eaten by a wumpus costs 1000 points
climbing out with goal awards 1000 points
wumpus location and gold locations are uniform random
the start spot is always sqaure [1,1]
each square has a pit with prob 0.2
you can only shoot once
grabbing gold is an action
climbing is an action

at each step sense these attributes:
stench, breeze, glitter, bump, scream
there is a scream in all squares if the wumpus dies
each of these are true or false
for example, if your near 3 pits you feel only 1 breeze not 3
you only see glitter when your on the square with the gold

actuators: forward, turn L, turn R, grab, shoot, climb
bumb is when you hit a wall, on the next round you feel a bump




we will use logic to develop the AI:
we have props (propositions), P, Q etc and True and False
