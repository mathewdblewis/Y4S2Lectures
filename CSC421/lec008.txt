these are the most important chapters
chapter 3: search
chapter 7: propositional logic

you can use the digital book but only the pdf can be open during the exam


there is a topic on adversarial search
this sounds interesting, read the text on this


we won't look at effective propositional model checking



satisfiability:
given a sentence, is the a set of variables which satisfies it?



midterm problem:
formulate sat as a search problem:
we need an initial state, states, actions, goal, path cost, transition model
initial state = no assignments to variables
actions: assign a value to a variable
state: a particular collection of assignments and lack of assignments
goal: an assignment in which the statement is true
this is called the partial state formulation

another way to do this is to pick a random assignment of variables
then move through the tree by changing the variables

NOTE: we don't care about the path cost in this situation




chapter 6: constraint satisfaction problems
consistent: all variables are so that no constraint is not violated
complete:   all variables are assigned
solution:   consistent and complete


unary constraint:  just filter the domains
binary constraint: add constraints
also multi constraint
