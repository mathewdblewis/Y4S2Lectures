conditional independence:
abilityInReading and lengthOfArms are dependent
however if you condition on age then abilityInReading and lengthOfArms are independent



laplace estimator:
add 1 to the count for all attribute value class combinations
add k (number of possible attribute values) to the denominator

eg: gender has 2 values so add 2 to denominator
age has 3 value, young, middle aged, old, so add 3 to denominator

naive assumption (naive model):
attributes are independent given a class
eg: P(young & high colestorol) = P(young)P(high colestorol)
