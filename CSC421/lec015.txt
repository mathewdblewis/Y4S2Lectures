last time: exact inference and aproximate inference
aproximate inference: simulate the system



today: hidden markov models
when it is sunny 80% of time you are happy
when its ranny 40% of time you are happy
P(S|S) = .8, P(R|S) = .2
P(R|R) = .6, P(S|R) = .4

the R/S to happy/unhappy probabilities are called emission probabilities
the other ones are transition probabilities

what is prob sunny given happy? use bayes formula

if for three days bob is happy, grumpy, happy, what was the weather?

for each possible hidden state, find the prob of that hidden state occuring
given the visible state
