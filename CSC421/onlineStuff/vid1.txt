chapter 20, especially part 1

say you get a sequence 1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1 from a die
what is the prob that the die is of a given type?
for example, a die with equal prob on values 1,2,3,4,5,6
for one with higher probs on particular values
do this in the obvious way

at 9:30 he talks about log likelyhood
in code he adds up the log of the prob of each die roll
and returns the sum

he does the candys thing again but with basian priors






video 2:
he talks about frequency distributions and how to code this
