logicistic regression:

ø(t) = e^t/(1+e^t) = 1/(1+e^(-t))
L = -∑ln(ø(yi*Wxi))     over all i



one against all:
make a classifier for each type of point
each will tell you if the point is of that type or if it is not

this leads to the data imbalance problem
eg: if you have 10 times more of data type A than data type B
it will just say everything is of type A even though it doesn't learn anything


to avoid this, we do classification A vs B for all pairs of classes A and B
