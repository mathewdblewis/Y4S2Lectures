we will rigorously derive the heat equation

conservation of heat equation:
add up all heat energy over a segment x=a to x=b
this is given by ∫e(x,t)Adx over x in [a,b]

d/dt ∫e(x,t)Adx = ø(a,t)*A - ø(b,t)*A
this is because ø is the rightward heat flow at position a and time t
and the change in the total energy in the segment is
the derivative of the total energy which is ∫e(x,t)Adx

we then modify it to account for external sources of heat
d/dt ∫e(x,t)Adx = ø(a,t)*A - ø(b,t)*A + ∫Q(x,t)Adx
now pull the derivative through the integral
∫∂/∂t e(x,t)Adx = ø(a,t)*A - ø(b,t)*A + ∫Q(x,t)Adx
now cancel the A's
∫∂/∂t e(x,t)dx = ø(a,t) - ø(b,t) + ∫Q(x,t)dx
now use FTOC (fundamental theorem of calculus) on the right side
∫∂e/∂t(x,t)dx = -∫∂ø/∂x(x,t)dx + ∫Q(x,t)dx
thus we have:
∫[∂e/∂t(x,t)+∂ø/∂x(x,t)-Q(x,t)]dx = 0
thus integral holds over all intervals [a,b]
thus we can conclude the integrand is 0, that is:
∂e/∂t(x,t)+∂ø/∂x(x,t)-Q(x,t) = 0
stated more compactly: ∂e/∂t+∂ø/∂x = Q
this works because we assume integrability (he claims, not sure how confident he is)


we write e(x,t)=c(x)p(x)u(x,t)
where u(x,t) is temperature at x, c(x) is specific heat, p(x) is mass density (mass per volume)
thus we have:
c(x)p(x)∂u/∂t(x,t) = -∂ø/∂x(x,t)+Q(x,t)

fouriers law of heat conductance: ø = -K0 ∂u/∂x
K0 is the thermal conductivity constant (measures the ability of material to conduct heat)
stick that in for ø and get this:
c(x)p(x)∂u/∂t(x,t) = K0*∂^2ø/∂x^2(x,t)+Q(x,t)

from here we get:
∂u/∂t = k(x) ∂^2u/∂x^2 + Qhat(x,t)
where k(x) = K0/[c(x)p(x)], Qhat(x,t) = Q(x,t)/[c(x)p(x)]

notice ∂u/∂t = k(x) ∂^2u/∂x^2 + Qhat(x,t)
is a dynamical system

notice this is a dynamical system on twice differentiable functions
