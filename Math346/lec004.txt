say 0 = kuxx and at x=0,L we have ux = 0
(ux = 0 means there is no change in heat at the boundary)
(thus there is no heat flux at the end points)
(thus total heat is preserved)
(this is call neuman)

Study ∫u(x,t)dx ovr x in [0,L] where u is a solution of ut = kuxx
∂/∂t ∫u(x,t)dx = ∫ut(x,t)dx = k∫uxx(x,t)dx = k(ux(L,t)-ux(0,t))
from the boundary conditions, we then know that ux(L,t) = ux(0,t) = 0
thus ∂/∂t ∫u(x,t)dx = 0 thus no heat is gained or lost

∂/∂t ∫u(x,t)dx = 0 thus ∂/∂t ∫u(x,t)dx doesn't change in time
thus ∂/∂t ∫u(x,t)dx = ∂/∂t ∫f(x)dx
where u(x,0) = f(x) from the ICs

moreover:
if u*(x) (the end stable solution) = C
then CL = ∫f(x)dx over [0,L]


he does a demo of the heat spreading out
notice that when you have fixed end points (fixed in heat)
you have an exponential rate of convergence
notice that when you have no heat flux at the boundaries (neuman)
the rate of convergence is slow (algebraic not exponential)





higher dimensional heat equation:
let R≤R^n be a region
rate of change of heat energy = heat flowing across the boundary per unit time
+ heat energy generated inside per unit time

heat energy in R = ∫∫∫cpu*dv over R
heat flux is now a vector, denoted ø(x,y)
|ø| is thus amount of heat flux per time per volume

if we demand that ø is parallel to the boundary of R
then no heat energy crosses it

if we do have heat flow, we can take the component of ø that leaves R
we do this by doting with the normal vector n

øn<0 is inward flow and øn>0 is outward


heat energy flowing out of R is ∫∫ø*n*ds
where ds is the differential along the surface are of R
NOTE: he puts a circle overlaping the double integrals
this is just a notation



heat equation: d/dt ∫∫∫cpu*dV = -∫∫øn*ds + ∫∫∫QdV over R
where Q is the source

note: divergence theorem is the higher dim analog of FTC
we use this to continue

div theorem:  ∫∫F*n*ds = ∫∫∫grad F dV over R
where grad = (∂/∂x,∂/∂y)

thus we can replace ∫∫ø*n*dv with ∫∫∫grad ø*dv
