given ∆U = 0 on region R, then foral p in R a ball or rad r0>0 about p
that is inside R we have
u(P) = ∫u(x)dx over ∂B(P,r0)   (R≤R^n then x in R^n)
we call this the mean value property

method of proof
assume u* is a solution of ∆u=0 in R
fix P, r0 appropriately and consider ∆u=0 on B(P,r0)
st. u=u* on B(P,r0)
to do this apply laplace on a disc




the maximum principle
the solution doesn't have a max or min in the interior of the domain
notice this result is implied by the proof from before for time dependent max principle




wellposedness and uniqueness:

def: a problem is well posed iff there is a unique solution
that depends continuously on BC and IC (boundary conditions and initial conditions)

suppose we have ∆u1=0 in R with u1=f(x) on the boundary
suppose we have ∆u2=0 in R with u2=g(x) on the boundary

set v=u1-u2 then ∆v = 0 (by linearity) in R
also v=f(x)-g(x) on the boundary
say f and g are close, then by the maximum principle, v is small (less than max(f-g))

proof of uniqueness:
say we have solutions u1 and u2
set v=u1-u2, then ∆v=0 in R and v=0 on ∂R
then by max principle, the only solution is v=0


solvability condition:
consider instead ∆u=0 in R and -k0*(ux,uy) = h on ∂R
k0 is a vector and h a scalar

integrate ∆u=0 on R
0 = ∫∫∫∆udv over R = ∫∫∫grad(grad(u))dV = ∫∫u'*ndS
where n is the normal vector
