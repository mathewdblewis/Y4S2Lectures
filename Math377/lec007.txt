today: non dimensionalization

example: mass on a spring:
mx" + cx' + kx = 0
m is the force, c is the damping and k is hooks law

recall there is a notion of period in a spring phenomenon
we want to recover this

our goal: express in non-dimensional terms
let x = x_c*X         where x_c is the characteristic and X is dimensionless
similarly t=t_c*T     where t_c is the characteristic and T is dimensionless

eg: if period of 5 seconds set t_c=5s
then 10 seconds = t_c*T   where T = 2 is dimensionless


recall the equation: mx"+cx'+kx = 0
dx/dt = dx/dX dX/dT dT/dt = x_c dX/dT /t_c = x_c/t_c * dX/dT
similarly d^2x/dt^2 = d/dt [x_c/t_c * dX/dT] = ... xc/tc^2 d^2X/dT^2
thus we have: mxc/tc^2 d^2X/dT^2 + cxc/tc dX/dT + kxcX = 0
equivalently: d^2X/dT^2 + (c/m)tc dX/dT + k/m tc^2 X = 0

goal: normalize coefficients to be 1:
we get to pick tc and xc

let assume we are in the case where c=0
then normalization implies tc = √(m/k)
this is the value of tc what we should pick so that the last coefficient is 1

normalizing the other way we get:
d^2X/dT^2 + (c/m)√(m/k) dX/dT + X = 0

(c/m)√(m/k) is called the damping ratio

so we should classify springs upto damping ratio, not mass and damping constants etc
this is the only parameter that matters


example: throw a ball up
simple model:      x" = -g, x(0) = 0, x'(0) = v0
newtonian model:   Fg = GMm/(x+R)^2 where R is earth radius and x is distance above the earth
M is eath mass and m is mass of object and g is constant

mx" = GMm/R^2 at x=0
call g = GM/R^2
so we get this mode:
x" = -gR^2/(x+R)^2, x(0) = 0, x'(0) = v0

for x<<1 the models collapse (become the same), but what is "small"?
we want to answer this question in terms of v0
because its the only thing we have that we can modify


non-dimensionalize: x = xc*X, t=tc*T
the condition x(0) = 0 becomes X(0)=0
 dX/dT = tc*v0/xc so we have X'(0) = tc*v0/xc
also we have: d^2X/dT^2 = -gR^2/(xcX+R)^2 * tc^2/xc^2
thus we have X" = -g/(xcX/R+1)^2 * tc^2/xc^2

now set tcv0/xc = 1
this gets us:

X" = -1/(Xv0^2/(gR)+1)
