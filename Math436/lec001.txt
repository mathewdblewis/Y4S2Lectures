calculus in R^n:

notation: v~(e)w    (pronounced "v is epsilon close to w)
this means |v-w|<e

definition: A function f:X->Y is cont at p in X
if foral e>0, TE. ∂>0 st. q~(e)p => f(q)~(e)f(p)

definition: a function f:U->R^m, U≤R^n open is diff at p in U iff TE. linear L:R^n->R^m
st. foral e>0 TE. ∂>0 st. q~(∂)p => f(q)~(e|q=p|) f(p)+L(q-p)
in this case L is called the derivative of f at p, L = Df_p

so the derivative is functions from U to M_(n,m)
we instead choose to look at the derivative as a map from UxR^n to R^m


example: the map that takes square matrix A to A^2
claim: DSA(H) = AH+HA
proof: S(A+H) ~(e|H|) S(A)+DSA(H)
he verifies this



def: f:U->R^m, U≤R^n open
∂f/∂ei(p) = Dfp(ei)



theorem: if the partials all exist then its differentiable at the spot
theorem: if both mixed partials exist in a neighbourhood of p
and are cont at p then they are equal


chain rule: if f:U->R^m, U open
g:V->R^j, V open
if f,g diff at p in U and q in V respectively
then D(gf)p = Dg(f(p)) * Dfp
