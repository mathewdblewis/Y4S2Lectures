Consider the following situation:
A stock is known to increase in price by 3 dollars
or decrease by 1 dollar between today and tomorrow
Also the interest rates are 0.
This results in a payout matrix like so:
outcome      1   2
bet 1        0   0
bet 2        3  -1
Where bet 1 is doing nothing (bonds) and bet 2 is buying stock.
It is clear that the RNM is [1,3]/4
we can use this RNM to price any security thats price depends only on
the price of the stock

Say the same setup will occur every week
Say I knew that there were a 50-50 chance of either case occuring every week
then I should buy the stock everytime and buy as much as I can
in the long run, this will lead to arbitrarily large profits
However this contradicts the assumption that the market is arbitrage free
More generally, if the "true" distribution of outcomes differs from the RNM
then this contradicts the arbitrage free assumption

In this sense, I think when we find the RNM we are finding the (possibly)
unique probability distribution that is compatible with the arbitrage free
assumption

in this sense, being arbitrage free forces the RNM to be the true distribution


























start at price 4, go down to 2 or up to 8, and no interest
what is the price of a call on this with strike 5?

buy S stock and B bond, cost: S+B, payout: 2S+B or S/2+B
buy 1 call, cost: C, payout 3 or 0

3 = 2S+B
0 = 2S+4B
3 = -3B thus B = -1
3 = 2S-1 thus S=2



up      down
3       0
