Def: log-normal RVs,  LN(µ,ø^2)
y~LN(µ,ø^2) if y=e^x where x~N(µ,ø^2)

NOTE: quas thinks it should be called exp-normal

lets find mean:
E(Y) = E(e^X) = ∫e^x*fx(x)dx over (-∞,∞)
where fx(x) is the pdf of the normal RV
the only thing you need to do is complete the square in the exponent
this is tedious, the result is e^(µ+ø^2/2)
so if X~N(µ,ø^2) then this is the mean of Y=e^X

now to find variance:
say Y~LN(µ,ø^2), then Y=e^X where X~N(µ,ø^2)
VAR(Y) = E(Y^2)-E(Y)^2 = E(e^(2X))-e^(2µ+ø^2)
notice 2X~(2µ,4ø^2) thus e^(2X) ~ LN(2µ,4ø^2)
thus E(e^(2X)) = e^(2µ+2ø^2)
thus VAR(Y) = e^(2µ+2ø^2) - e^(2µ+ø^2) = e^(2µ+ø^2)[e^(ø^2)-1]

summary:
let Y~LN(µ,ø^2) then EXP(Y) = e^(µ+ø^2/2), VAR(Y) = e^(2µ+2ø^2) - e^(2µ+ø^2)





Central Limit Theorem (CLT):
if you add up independent RVs of "comprable size"
the sum is aproximiately normal with mean ∑means and variance ∑variances

notice as a corroloary, if we multiply independent RVs
we get something aproximately LN

this is a good way to model share prices for example


Formal version of CLT
let (Xn)_(1 to ∞) be a sequence of IID RVs with finite variance
let E(Xi) = µ, VAR(Xi) = ø^2
then ∑(Xi-nµ)/(ø√n) converges in distribution to N(0,1)

in the rough version we have ∑Xi converges in dist to N(∑µi,∑øi^2)


chapter 3: brownian motion

what is a random variable?
think of it as a program that returns a real number
each time you run it you get different numbers
this gives a distribution
instead the function could return a list of reals
this would be a family of random variables

brownian motion:
BM(a,µ,ø^2) is a family of random variables (Xt)_(t≥0) st:
(1)  X0 = a
(2)  X_(t+s)-X(t) is independent of Xu foral u in [0,t]
(3)  X(t+s)-X(t) ~ N(µs,sø^2)

in words, disjoint incriments are independent normals
