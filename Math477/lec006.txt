X(t+s) = Xt + µs + ø√sN
this is distribution of X(t+s) given Xt
when you don't know anything else


brownian motion is the limit of a random walk
consider RW with time step ∆, move up or down by ±ø√∆


he claims that Xt = Z1+...Z(t/∆) is like a brownian motion for small ∆
this is obvious, he "proves" this, its slightly handwavy




Theorem: consider a random walk Xn with n in [1,...N]
conditioned on XN = k, all paths are equally likely
where prob of going up is p
he proves this





corollary:
let ø^2 be fixed, let xt~BM(0,µ,ø^2)
the conditional distribution of Xs
given that Xt=x doesn't depend on µ
