last time:
P(M(t)≥y: Xt=x) = e^(-2y(y-x)/(tø^2)) for y≥x and 1 otherwise

today:
thm: P(M(t)≥y) = e^(2yµ/ø^2) Ø((µt+y)/(ø√t)) + Ø((y-µt)/(ø√t))
where Ø(x) = P(N>x)

proof: P(M(t)≥y) = ∫P(M(t)≥y: Xt=x)fx(x)dx
...
this is tedious calculus





cameron-martin theorem:
let w be a RV whose value is determined by Xu where Xu ~ BM(0,µ,ø^2)
E_u(w) = exp(-µ^2t/(2ø^2))E0(w*exp(µXt/ø^2))
where E_u denotes E for BM(0,µ,ø^2) and E0 denotes E for BM(0,0,ø^2)

interpretation: BM(0,0,ø^2) and BM(0,µ,ø^2) see same paths with different probabilities







principal goal of the course: to price options
first model the price of the option by a GBM
we aproximate GBM with multiplicative random walks
we use risk neutral measure (RNM)

price = expectation of payout

we take the RNM for random walks and use it to get a RNM for GBM


sections of the course:
(1) probability and GBM
(2) money
(3) arbitrage (leads to RNM for random walks)
(4) GBMs and black scholes



chapter 4: interest rates
often discus contracts involving money at different times
eg: buy shares now and sell in 6 months
assume interest rate is fixed and known (bonds)

bonds: you pay money now and get a fixed amount of money at a specific date in the future

continuous time: future payout is P*exp(rt)
t is time period (always in years)
present value PV is (future)e^(-rt)

we won't distinguish between 100 dollars now and 100exp(rt) dollars in t years


discrete time:
future payout: P(1+R)^n
n = number of time steps
R = interest / step
PV = future payout, (1+R)^(-n)
