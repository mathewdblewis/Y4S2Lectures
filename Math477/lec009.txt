chapter 5: arbitrage
underlying the entire course, we have the idea that any finanacial product
can be bought or sold in any quantity, even fractional quantities
at the same price

we can buy 1 share of MSFT at 166.16 for example
and sell 3 MSFT for 3*166.16

basically there are no transaction fees

similarly the interest you get when lending
is the same as when borrowing over a fixed period
although this is not acurate for individual people
this is relatively close to true for institutions such as banks
thus everything can be converted to dollar value

say you buy MSFT for 166 today and sell in 3 months for 174
then the net change is 174e^(-r/4)-166
r is known in advanced, it is the interest rate for a 3 month deposite


you can short shares, that is, sell shares you don't own
this is like owning a negative number of shares
eg: short 5 MSFT shares today then settle in 3 months
then net change is 5(166-174e^(-r/4))

notice everything is measured in todays dollars



arbitrage:
a combination of purchases and sales (not nessisarily all today)
which is garenteed to make a profit
informally "free money"


we will ensure prices are chosen so that no arbitrage happens


call option: a contract giving the holder the right (not the obligation)
to buy one (exactly one) share at a fixed cost K and fixed time T
this is called a European call option
with American options you can do so at any time upto and including T
we will look at more exotic options later


eg: MSFT, K = 170 (you have a right to buy it at the price 170)
If S(1/4) = 174, use the option to buy the share, then sell the share emediately
this earns you 4 dollars net
the cashflow is 4e^(-r/4)-C where C is the cost of the option
if S(1/4) = 168 then don't buy it
buying is called exercising
in this case the payout is 0 so the cashflow is 0-C

notation: x^+  (I will write x`) denotes max(x,0)
payout of a call is (S(t)-k)` in time t dollars




example: (unrealistic)
single time step (this means use discount factor 1/(1+R), that is, descritized time)
say we have a share worth 100 after 1 time step it will be worth 50$ or 200$
interest of period is R
call option with strike price K = 150
so at the end of the period we either get 50$ (if the stock becomes worth 200)
or 0 (if its worth less)

lets replicate the call using shares and bonds
bonds means investing money in the bank with gareenteed interest rate r
buy x shares and put y in the bank
whats it worth if the stock price goes up?      200x+(1+R)y
whats it worth if the stock price goes down?    50x+(1+R)y
to replicate the option, equate these with 0 and 50 from before
200x+(1+R)y = 50
50x+(1+R)y = 0
150x = 50, thus x=1/3, thus y = -50/(3(1+R))


so we can replicate a call by buying 1/3 a share and borrowing 50/(3(1+R)) from the bank
