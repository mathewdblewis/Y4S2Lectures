recall we buy 1/3 share and -50/(3(1+R)) in the bank


the cost of the portfolio is 1/3*100-50/3*9/10 where R = 1/9
this equals 18.33
cost of the call must be the same to avoid arbitrage



say you can buy a call for 20$, then you short a call and do the portfolio
this gives an arbitrage

say you can buy a call for 17, then buy the call and sell the portfolio




the law of one price (loop)
If two portfolios (pf1 and pf2) are such that for all possible outcomes
the payout of pf1 is the same as the payout of pf2, then they cost the same
if this were not true then we could do arbitrage



put call parity formula:
european put is the right to sell a share for the strike price (K) at time T (exercise time)
payout of a put:
sell share for K when true price is S
payout: K-S when S<K otherwise 0 = (K-S)`

facts:
for c>0, (cx)` = cx`, x`+(-x)` = |x|, x`-(-x)` = x, (x+y)` â‰¤ x`+y`


putcall parity formula is a relationship between cost of a call and
a put on the same stock with same strike
C-P = S-Ke^(-rt)
where C is cost of call and P cost of put
S is stock price now and K is strike price
r is interest rate and t is exercise time

to prove this, use the loop


pf1: buy call sell put, cost is C-P    
pf1 payout: (St-K)`-(K-S)`
because (St-K)` is the payout of a call and the payout of a put is (K-S)`
however you have a negative put, so the value is (St-K)`-(K-S)`
notice (St-K)`-(K-S)` = St-K

now find something worth St at time t (buy a share)
now find something worth K at time t, (borrow Ke^(-rt))
so pf2 should be buy a share and borrow ke^(-rt)
