call = buy, put = sell

thm: its never advantagous to exercise a us call early
proof: compare 2 strategies:
suppose we're holding a us call(K,t)
suppose time now is s
suppose Ss>K (otherwise no point in exercising the option)
strategy 1: exercise the call now
strategy 2: sell 1 share and invest ke^(-r(t-s)) and wait until time t

           payout   now                 time t
strat1:             Ss-K                0
strat2:             Ss-Ke^(-r(t-s))     -St+K + (St-K)`

notice -St+K + (St-K)` = 0 when St>K and if St<k then get positive number
so we get at least 0 in both cases


so strat2 pays more now and at least as much as time t
so we should never exercise early


note: this is not the case with american puts
he recommends looking into this
there is an exercise boundary that when the price hits the exercise boundary
it is good to exercise an american put


generalized loop (gloop)
given 2 portfolios pf1 and pf2, if payout(pf1) ≤ payout(pf2) in all situations
then cost(pf1)≤cost(pf2), otherwise arbitrage



forward contract:
agreement made where you agree now to pay an amount F at time T
and receive one stock at time t
note: this is not the right to buy a stock, but rather the obligation to buy a stock
no payment at t=0, money only changes hands at the moment of purchase

what is the value of such a contract? use loop


let pf1 be the forwards contract
let pf2 be buying a stock and borrowing from the bank the same amount
       0               t
pf1:   0               St-F
pf2:   S0-Fe^(-rt)     St-F

so we should have S0-Fe^(-rt) = 0
so F = S0e^(rt)



Commodity futures
1 eur today is worth 1.0603 USD
forwards contract: 1 eur in 3 months worth 1.0628

the difference is due to different interest rates in the us and europe

use the loop to find the relationship
find 2 ways to obtain 1 euro in 3 months
pf1: buy 1 euro now
pf2: buy 1 euro in 3 months

he finds that 1.0628/1.0603 = exp((rus-reu)/4)


he talks about convex functions
