recall how calls work:
you can buy at time t at price K

gloop: suppose 2 portfolios pf1 and pf2
payout pf1 ≤ payout pf2 in all situations implies cos(pf1)≤cost(pf2)

consider cost of a call on stock
at exercise time t as a function of strike price k C(k)
theorem: C(K) is convex

pf1: buy call with strike price (1-l)k1+lk2
pf2: buy (1-l) of call with strike price k1 and l of call with strike price k2
payout of pf1: (s(t)-((1-l)k1+lk2))`
payout of pf2: (1-l)(s(t)-k1)` + l(s(t)-k2)`

to use gloop, we should how that the first payout is always less than the second
recall (x+y)` ≤ x`+y` and (cx)`=cx` for c≥0, from this the result is clear

thus pay(pf1)≤pay(pf2)

we have now proved c(K) is convex (why is this?)

also we have that C(∞) = 0, to see why, if the strike price is too high
it will be very unlikely to happen, and thus has very low value
also the function is decreasing
also C(0) = the price of the stock


to show this last equality holds use the loop:
pf1: buy the security for price C(0)
pf2: don't buy it, spend x dollars to buy 1 stock

payout1: (S(t)-0)` = S(t)` = S(t)
payout2: S(t)

notice they have the same payout, so they must have the same cost
so x equals C(0), thus we must spend C(0) to buy 1 stock, so C(0) = S0




the time machine option (not real, he just invented this)
pays s(1/4) at time 1/2
what is the value of the option?
the equivalent portfolio: buy e^(-r/4) stock, wait 3 months, then sell it and put money in bank

the cost of the pf2 is e^(-r/4)s0 thus the cost of this option must be e^(-r/4)s0

what is the shape of the graph?
what is C(K) for small K?
payout should occur, so it we assume it does occur, then price should be St-Ke^(-rt)
however we know this is not acutally for sure (not 100% going to happen)
so the price should be slightly higher


note: a call is "in the money" if St>K
