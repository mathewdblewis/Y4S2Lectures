arbitrage theorem: let A be nxm matrix, either
TE x in R^n st. x^TA>0 or
TE p in R^m st. pi≥0, ∑pi=1, Ap=0

consider buying x1 bet1, x2 bet2 ... xn betn
what is net payout?
if outcome j, payout is x^T*A*ej where ej is the vector with 1 at j and 0 elsewhere

thus x^TA>0 means you always make money, that is, arbitrage
so this theorem can be stated like so:

if there is no arbitrage then there is a risk neutral measure


to prove this we will use the seperating hyperplane theorem
let U,V be two disjoint convex subsets of R^m
then TE z≠0 in R^m and c in R st. xz≤c foral x in U and xz≥c foral x in V
if V open then xz>c foral x in V

in words, there is a hyperplane between any pair of disjoint convex sets



proof for compact sets U and V
let f(u,v) = |u-v|^2
by compactness f attains its min, thus TE u0,v0 st. f(u0,v0)≤f(u,v) foral u in U and v in V
since U and V are disjoint, u0≠v0, thus f(u0,v0)≠0
let z=v0-u0 and c=(u0+v0)*z/2

notice v0*z-c = v0z-(u0+v0)*z/2 = z(v0-u0)/2 = |z|^2/2 > 0, also u0z-c<0
let r(t) = tv0+(1-t)v
by convexity r(t) in V foral t in [0,1]
f(u,r(t))≥f(u0,v0) foral t because v0 was chosen to minimize f
f(u0,r(0))=f(u0,v0)
he then does some differentiation, I think this is overly complex




here is the theorem stated more generally (not his notes)
consider convex space X
foral disjoint convex U and V TE convex W st. U≤W and X-W convex
try proving this instead



now prove the arbitrage theorem:
suppose (1) does not hold (no arbitrage)
let U = {x^TA: x in R^n}   (row space of A)
let V = {y: y>0 and y in R^m}
by assumption U and V are disjoint
he then proves U and V are convex (this is obvious)
thus we may use the hyperplane theorem
thus TE z≠0 and c st. uz<c foral u in U and vz>c foral v in V

vz>c foral v in V and uz≤c foral u in U
0 in U implies 0z≤c implies c≥0
notice [a,a...a] in V for a>0 thus az>c implies 0≥c when taking limit a to 0
thus c=0, thus the hyperplane goes through the origin
vz>0 foral v in V and uz≤0 foral u in U

if u in U then -u in U, thus uz≤0 and (-u)z≤0 thus uz=0 foral u in U
thus Az=0 because z is orthogonal to all things in the row space U
recall vz>0 foral v in V
let v = [a,a,...a,1,a...a], then zv>0 because v in V
as a->0, we have zv=z_j≥0
so all components of z are non negative numbers
so z≠0 (by the seperating hyperplane theorem) and zi≥0 foral i
thus ∑zj>0, let p = z/∑zj, then p satisfies the theorem



V"t^2+V't=lV
V = t^p
p(p-1)t^(p-2)+pt^(p-1)=lt^p
p(p-1)+pt=lt^2
