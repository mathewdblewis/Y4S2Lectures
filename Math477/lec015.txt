arbitrage theorem:
A nxm matrix, either (but not both) of these hold:
(1)  TE x in R^n st x^T*A>0
(2)  TE p in R^m, pi≥0, ∑pi=1, Ap=0

notice if we put probability p on the bets, then because Ap=0
all strategies (weighted bets) give 0 return


if you are given a matrix he suggests when given such a matrix
to check for a risk neutral measure p first

consider nxn matrix A = -1 at all entries except diagonals, which are d1...dn
solve Ap=0, ∑pi=1, pi≥0
we get these equations:  dipi+(1-pi) = 0 for i in [1,n]
so pi=1/(di+1) foral i
so if ∑1/(di+1) = 1 we have a RNM (risk neutral measure) otherwise arbitrage

we can construct the arbitrage by buying 1/(1+di) of bet i when ∑1/(1+di)<1
net profit if j wins is -(∑1/(1+di)-1/(1+dj)) + dj/(1+dj)
= -∑1/(1+di) + (1+dj)/(1+dj) = 1 - ∑1/(1+di) > 0, so we have arbitrage
if ∑1/(1+di)>1, negate this strategy

note that bookmakers will have ∑1/(1+di)>1 however they won't allow negative bets


a systematic way of doing this, find a RNM
given A, set Ap=0, ∑pi=1
he sets up a linear system and solves
if the solution has negative entries, we know there must be arbitrage

note: we will only look at the 2x2 case because it naturally arises
