recall the arbitrage theorm:
(1)  TE x st. x^TA>0       (arbitrage)
(2)  TE pâ‰¥0 st. Ap=0       (RNM)


recall this example:
[ 5 -8  2]
[-3  5 -1]

recall there was no RNM

he solves the linear programming problem by illistration



fact: if a,b,c,d>0 and a/b<c/d then ab<(a+c)/(b+d)<c/d



connecting the arbitrage theorem to option pricing
reconsider previous example:
100 goes up either to 200 or 50
we have a call with SP = K
the interest rate is R

we get this matrix:
     up             down
bet [200/(1+R)-100  50/(1+R)-100]

he gets this RNM:
p = [1+2R  2-2R]/3

he adds another row to introduce another bet, the call
     up             down
bet  [200/(1+R)-100  50/(1+R)-100]
call [50/(1+R)-C     -C          ]

beause only 1 p worked for the top row, specifically the one we found before
we know there is only a solution if the new row times p is 0
so we get an equation and solve for C

he solves the equation, we get:
C = [50/(1+R),0/(1+R)]*p
notice this is the expectation wrt RNM of the payout


theorem:
given a collection of instruments with net returns Aij (return of ith intrument when j happens)
and given a new instrucment with payout k1...km
a price for new instrucment is arbitrage free iff
P = E_(RNM)(P) for some RNM for A     (P is payout)

he proves this



key formula:  price = E_RNM(P)
where P is the payout
