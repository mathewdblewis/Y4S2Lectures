examples:
let L = {+,-,*,0,1,<}
here are some L-formulas: x+y=x*y, x*(-y)<0, foral x, TE y, (x<y)
notice this may or may not be true

def: a variable symbol appearing under the scope of a quantifier is called bound
a variable symbol that isn't bound is free

we will assume all varaibles are bound or free, not both
we won't quantify variables twice



notation: if ø is an L-formula, we write ø(x1,x2...xn)
to denote that x1...xn are free variables in ø


def: let L be a language, M an L-structure
ø(x) an L-formula, a in M
we define M |= ø(a)
this is pronouced in four ways:
"M models ø(a)", "ø(a) is true in M", "M satisfies ø(a)", "M beleives ø(a)"
recursively using the definition of formulas
if ø(x) is "t1(x) = t2(x)" then M |= ø(a) iff t1^m(a) = t2^m(a)
if ø(x) is R(t1(x),...tn(x)) then M |= ø(a) iff (t1^m(a),...tn^m(a)) in R^m
if ø(x) is c(x) V d(x) then M |= ø(a) iff M |= c(x) or M |= d(a)
similarly for "&" and "not"

if ø(x) is "FA y, g(x,y)"
then M |= ø(a) iff FA b in M, M |= g(a,b)
if ø(x) is "TE y, g(x,y)"
M |= ø(a) iff TE some b in M st. M |= g(a,b)

example: let L = Lgrp
Here is an Lgrp formula: ø(x,y) = "xy=yx"
if M=(Z,+,-,0)
M |= ø(2,4)
if M=(D3,*,`,e)
then M !|= ø(r,j)


If G is any group and a in G
G |= "FA x ø"(a) iff a in Z(G)

now consider this statement:
G |= "FA x FA y (xy=yx)" iff G abelian


def: an L-sentence is an L-formula without free variables
an L-theory is a set of L-sentences
given an L-structure M, the complete L-theory of M is denoted Th(M)
this is Th(M) = {ø| ø is an L-sentence and M |= ø}

notice foral M, "FA x, (x=x)" is in Th(M)



def: let M and N be L-structures
we say they are elementarily equivalent iff they have the same complete theory
that is, Th(M) = Th(N)
put differently, M and N satisfy the same sentences
in this case we write M==N

note: M==N iff foral L-sentences ø, M|=ø iff N|=ø


theorem: if M≈N then M==N
where ≈ denotes isomorphic

NOTE: the converse is usually false

we try to learn about M by studying the class of structures
elementarily equivalent to M


fact (to do on assignment)
if M is finite (the underlying set is finite)
then being elementarily equivalent does imply isomorphic

however if M is infinite, then there are alway structures M and N with M==N yet M!≈N
