recall X≤M^n is definable if there is a formula ø(x,y) and a b in M st. X = {X in M| M|=ø(a,b)}

thm: suppose that X≤M^n and X is A-dfbl, then foral automorphisms ø of M st.
ø(a)=a foral a in A, ø(X)=X

proof: suppose ø(x,y), a in A are st X = {b in M^n| M|=ø(b,a)}
suppose ø is an automorphism of M fixing A pointwise

suppose ø is an automorphism of M fixing A pointwise foral b in M^n
b in X iff M|=ø(b,a) iff M|=ø(ø(b),ø(a)) iff ø(b) in X

note: the converse of this theorem is false
let M be the real ordered field
fact: M has only one automorphism
thus all subsets of R are automorphism invariant
thus if the converse were true, then all subsets of R would be definable
however there are 2^R subsets of R, yet only |R| of them are definable
he doesn't prove there are only |R| of them because this is a question for the grad students




example: R is not definable in C = (C,+,-,*,0,1)
suppose R was definable, then R is definable over a finite set A≤C
fact: if x,y in C are algebraically independent over A
then TE. sigma in Aut(C) st. ø(x) = y
algebraically independent means there isn't a 2-variate polynomial that takes (x,y) to 0
in particular, we can choose x in R and y not in R and find such an automorphism
then by our theorem R is not A-definable


def: recall a theory is a set of sentences
if T is a theory and ø a sentence we write T |= ø if:
M |= T implies M |= ø

example: in Lgrp, let Tgrp be the axioms for group
Tgrp |= ø where ø is:
foral z, (foral x, xz=x implies z=1)

hwoever Tgrp |!= foral x (xx=1)
this is because there are groups where x^2=1 isn't true
also Tgrp |!= not (foral x (xx=1))
this is because there are such group


def: a theory T is complete if foral sentences ø, either T |= ø or T|= not ø


NOTE: T is complete iff foral M,N |= T implies M==N
that is, if M and N are models for T, then they are equivalent

example: foral M, Th(M) = {ø| M|=ø} is complete

example: let L=ø, let T∞ be the theory
T∞ = {"TE x1, TE x2, x1≠x2", "TE x1, TE x2, TE x3, x1≠x2 ^ x1≠x3", ... }
T∞ is complete


example: in Lrng let ACFp be the theory of algebriacally closed fields of characteristic p
eg: "FA a,b,c, (a≠b implies TE x, ax^2+bx+c=0) in ACFp"
it expresses that all quadratics have roots
so we include a statement for each degree

note: turns out that T∞ and ACFp being complete are proven in much the same way



eg: L = {<}, DLO (dense linear orderings without endpoints)
note: DLO has only finitely many axioms
so it effectly only has one axioms (just "and" them all together)



main goals: given T, how can we build interesting models
If T is complete, how can we tell models of T apart


first question: given T, does T have any models?

Theorem: (compactness theorem)
let T be a theory, then T has a model iff foral finite subset T0≤T, T0 has a model

NOTE: if M |= T then M |= T0 foral subsets T0≤T
(so we have one direction done)

converse: for each finite T0≤T we have a model M_T0 |= T0
we need to assemble these models into a model of T
