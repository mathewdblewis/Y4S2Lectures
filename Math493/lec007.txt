our goal this week: compactness theorem:
let T be an L-theory, If all finite subsets of T have a model then T has a model

def: suppose I is a non empty set
A collection F of subsets of I has the finite intersection property (fip)
if whenever A,...An in F then intersect{A1...An} ≠ ø

a collectionf F≤P(I) is a filter on I iff:
ø not in F, I in F, if A and B are in F then A intersect B in F
if A≤B and A in F then B in F


example:
pick any i in I, let F = {A≤I: i in A}
notice this is a filter on I
it is called the principle aka fixed filter generated by I

example:
suppose I infinite, and let F = {A≤I: I-A is finite}
then F is a filter on I. It is called the Frechet filter (aka cofinite filter)

Fact: suppose I≠ø and F≤P(I) has FIP
then TE filter G≤P(I) st. F≤G

to do this, close under finite intersection, then close under superset
this is the filter generated by a FIP

def: A filter U on I is an ultrafitler if it is a maximal filter
(eg: if U≤F≤P(I) and F is a filter, then U = F)


Fact: U is an ultrafilter iff U is a filter and foral A≤I, either A in U or I-A in U

eg: principal filters are ultrafilters



fact: every filter is contained in an ultrafilter
(this uses zorns lemma and axiom of choice)

fact: an ultrafilter is a non principlal iff it contains the frechet filter


eg: let I be infinite, the frechet filter F is not an ultrafilter
let A≤I be st. A and I-A are infinite
then A and I-A not in F



Given L-structures Mi, i in I and an ultrafilter U in I
we define a new structure called the ultraproduct of the Mi's
which is some sense "averages" them


def: suppose Mi, i in I are non empty sets
we denote the cartisian product of the Mi's by ∏Mi
define a relation ~ on ∏Mi by
(xi)_(i in I) ~ (yi)_(i in I) iff {i: xi=yi} is in the ultrafilter

one can check that ~ is an equivalence relation
(this requires the various properties of ultrafilters)

let ∏Mi/U be the set of equivalence classes
∏Mi/U is called the ultraproduct of the Mi's by U
we will write ∏_U(Mi) for simplicity


now consider structures, K = ∏Mi/U is universe for the structure
supose c in L is a constant symbol
c^K = [(c^mi)_{i in I}]_U
where [.]_U is the equivalence class in ∏_U(Mi)

suppose R is an n-ary relation symbol
([a^1_i]_u,...[a^n_i]_u) in R^K
iff {i in I: (ai^1...ai^n) in R^Mi}

also this is well defined

f^K([a1],[a2]...[an]) = [b] iff {i: f^K(a1...an)=bi}
