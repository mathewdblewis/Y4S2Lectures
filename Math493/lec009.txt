last time: tos theorem:
K = ∏Mi/U, K |= ø([a1],...[an]) iff {i in I| Mi |= ø(a1(i),...an(i))}

today: (1) the "exists" step of the proof of tos
       (2) compactness



ø(x1...xn) is TE y g(x1...xn,y)
K |= ø([a1]...[an]) implies there is [b] in K st. K |= g([a1],...[an],[b])
implies {i in I: Mi |= g(a1(i)...an(i),b(i))} in U
implies {i in I: Mi |= TE y, g(a1(i),...an(i),y)} in U


now the reverse direction
suppose A = {i in I: Mi |= TE y, g(a1(i)...an(i),y)} in U
Given i in I, i in A, we can find bi in Mi st. Mi |= g(a1(i)...an(i),bi)
if i not in A, pick any bi in Mi
let b = (bi)_{i in I}
then {i in I: Mi |= g(a1(i)...an(i),b(i)} = A in U
thus by induction hypothesis, K |= g([a1]...[an],[b])



def: let M be an L-structure, U an ultrafilter, the ultraproduct ∏Mi/U
with each Mi=M is the ultrapower of M by U, we denote this by M^U

cor: M == M^U foral ultrafilter U   (elementarily equivalent)

facts about ultrapowers:
if U is a principle ultrafilter M and M^U are isomorphic
if M is finite, M and M^U are isomorphic
(this follows from the cor and the result in the assignment)
if M is countable and U a non principle ultrafilter on the naturals then |M^U|=|R|




theorem: compactness
let T an L-theory, then T has a model iff all finite subsets of T have a model

the forward direction is trivial, lets prove the reverse

let I = {∆≤T: ∆ is finite}
foral ∆ in I, let M_∆ be a model of ∆
for each ø in T, let Aø = {∆ in I: M∆ |= ø}
note ø in ∆ implies ∆ in Aø but Aø may have others

claim: {Aø| ø in T} has fip
proof: consider Aø1...Aøn
let ∆ = {ø1...øn}
then M∆ |= øi foral i thus ∆ in Aø1 intersect ... Aøn ≠ 0

let U be an ultrafilter on I, st Aø in U foral ø
let M = ∏M∆/U, pick ø in T, {∆ in I: M∆ |= ø} = Aø in U
thus by tos theorem, the ultraproduct M|=ø






examples of using compactness
there is no theory in the language of groups T st. M|=T iff M is a cyclic group
proof: say there is such a T bwoc
let L be the language of group theory along with an uncountable set of constants I
and the ca are new constants in L = Lgrp U {ca | a in I}

let T* = T U {ca≠cb|a≠b in I}
(we add to the theory T the statement that all constants are different)

claim: T* is consistent
by compactness it sufficies to show this for each finite subset thus consider ∆≤T* finite
lets satisfy all of T and finitely many of the constants

suppose a1...an in I are the finitely many constants mentioned in ∆
consider the group Z(n+1) and let M∆ be that group with ca1^M∆ = 1 ... can^M∆ = n
and foral other a in I, ca^M∆ = 0
so this group M∆ is a model of ∆
by compactness there is a M* that models T*
thus M* is an uncountable cyclic group which is impossible









theorem: suppose G = (V,E) is a planar graph, then G can be 4-coloured
proof: this is true for V finite
let L = {E,C1,C2,C3,C4}
E is binary relation (edges) and C1...C4 are unary relations (they tell you the colour)
let L_G = L U {Cv| v in V} where cv are constant symbols
T = {foral x, c1(x) or c2(x) ... c4(x), foral x,y E(x,y) implies, not(c1(x)&c1(Y)) ... }
U {E(cv,cw)| v is adjacent to w in G}
U {not E(cv,cw)| v not adjacent to w in G}

claim: T is consistent
proof: each finite subset of T asserts the existance of a 4-colouring of a finite subgraph of G
by compactness we have a model M |= T
then c1...c4 are a 4 colouring of M and the interpretations of the constants of M
form a graph isomorphic to G
