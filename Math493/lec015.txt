let language L and T an L-theory
we say T has quantelim (QE) iff:
FA L formulas ø(x) TE a QF (quant free) formula k st.
T |= FA x, (ø(x) iff k(x))

NOTE: it is permitted for k to have free variables appearing that don't appear in ø

theorem: in L=ø (the empty set), T∞ has QE
proof: first suppose ø is a sentence

since T∞ is complete either T∞ |= ø or T∞ !|= not ø
if T∞ |= ø then T∞ |= "FA x, (ø iff x=x)"
if T∞ |= not ø then T∞ |= "FA x, (ø iff x≠x)"
now suppose ø has free variables x1...xn

foral functions ø:{(i,j)| 1≤i<j≤n} -> {T,F} define Xø(x1...xn) like so:
Xø(x1...xn) := (and xi=xj over all i,j st. ø(i,j)=T) and (and xi≠xj over all i,j st. ø(i,j)=F)
Note that Xø is QF

let A = {ø: {(i,j)| 1≤i<j≤n} -> {T,F}} st. TE a1...an in N st. Xø(a) and ø(a)


case 1: A is empty
if this case, N |= FA x, not ø(x)
so N |= "FA x, ø(x) iff x1≠x1"
since T∞ complete, T∞ |= "FA x, ø(x) iff x1≠x1"

case 2: A is not empty
let k(x1...xn) be "and over all ø in A of Xø"
then by def of A, N |= "FA ø(x) -> k(x)"
by completeness, so to for T∞ as for N

suppose b1...bn in N and N |= k(b1...bn)
then there is some ø in A st. N |= Xø(b1...bn)
by def of A, there are c1...cn in N st.
N |= Xø(c1...cn) and ø(c1...cn)

This proof has gotten to harry for me


this proof was a pain so we need better methods for checking this
we will now work towards a test for this
there is a large number of these tests, we will look only at some of them

lemma: suppsoe M and N are L-structures and M a substructure of N (M≤N)
suppose ø(x) is QF L-formula and a (a tupple) in M
then M|=ø(a) iff N|=ø(a)

the proof is boring he says, use induction on formulas


theorem: say L has a constant symbol c and T be an L theory
and ø(x) is an L-formula, then TFAE:
(1)  TE a QF L-formula k st. T |= "FA x, (ø(x) iff k(x))"
(2)  FA M|=T and N|=T, FA L-structure A st A≤M and A≤N and all a in A
     M|=ø(a) iff N|=ø(a)

proof: of 1=>2
M |= ø(a) iff M |= k(a) becasue M|=T
iff A |= k(a)           by lemma
iff N |= k(a)           by lemma
iff N |= ø(a)           because N |= T

proof 2=>1
easy cases: if T|="FA x, ø(x)" pick k to be "c=c"
if T |= "FA x, not ø(x)" pick k to be "c≠c"
we can assume neither of these hold

let G = {k(x): k if QF and T|="FA x, ø(x)->k(x)"}
let d be new constant symbols

claim: (proof next time)  T union G(d) |= ø(d)

say we prove the claim, then by compactness, there are k1...kn in G
st. T union {k1(d)...kn(d)} |= ø(d)

then T |= (k1(d) and ...kn(d) -> ø(d))
since d isn't in the original langauge of T, we can interpret them however we like

thus T |= "FA x, k1(x) and ... kn(x) iff ø(x)"
