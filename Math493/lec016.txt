theorem: (this is proven in the book)
L has constant symbol c, T an L-theory
ø(x) an L-formula, TFAE:
(1)  TE QF k st. T |= FA x, (ø(x) iff k(x))
(2)  FA M,N |= T, FA A if A≤M and A≤N then FA a in A, M |= ø(a) iff N|=ø(a)

proof of 2=>1
if T|= FA x ø(x) pick k to be "c=c"
if T|= FA x not ø(x) pick k to be "c≠c"
let G(x) = {k(x): k is QF and T|="FA x, ø(x) -> k(x)"}

let d be new constant symbol

claim: T U G(d) |= ø(d)
saw last time proving the claim proves the theorem

proof of claim:
say bwoc the claim is false, then TUG(d) |!= ø(d)
then TE M st. M |= TUG yet M|!=ø(d)

let A be the substructure of M generated by d^M
let ∑ = T U diag(A) U ø(d)

subclaim: ∑ is consistent (has a model)

proof of subclaim:
by compactness, if not, then TE k1...kn in diag(A) st.
T |= "FA x, k1(x) ^ ... kn(x) -> not ø(x)"

Thus T|= "FA x, ø(x) -> not k1(x) or ... not kn(x)"

since each ki in diag(A), each ki is QF
so V_{i=1}^{n} of not ki(d) in G(d)
since M |= G(d), M |= V not ki(d)

since A≤M and d in A and "V not ki(d)" is QF, we have that
A |= "V not ki(d)"
thus A |= "not ki(d)" for some i, however this contradicts that ki comes from the diagram
this proves the subclaim



so let N |= ∑, (∑ = T U diag(A) U {ø(d)})
then N |= T since N |= diag(A), A≤N
N |= not ø(d) and N |= ø9d) and A≤M and A≤N and d in A
which contradicts (2), thus the result holds


lemma: suppose L a language and T an L-theory
suppose FA QF k0(x,y) TE QF k(x) st. T|="FA x, (TE y, k0(x,y)) iff k(x)"
then T has QE

proof: induction on formulas
basecase: ø is QF
if a1 and a2 are equivalent to QF formulas
then so are "a1 and a2", "a1 or a2", "not a1"
the quantifier step is almost exactly the hypothesis of the theorem
suppose ø := "TE y, a(x,y)"
by induction hypothesis, we have QF k0(x,y) st. T |= FA x,y, a(x,y) iff k0(x,y)
then T |= FA x ø(x) iff TE y, k0(x,y)
then by hypothesis, TE QF k(x) st. T |= FA x, TE y, k0(x,y) iff k(x)
thus T |= FAx, ø(x) iff k(x)






quantifer elimination theorem (QE test):
suppose the following:
(1)  language L with constant symbol c
(2)  T an L-theory
(3)  foral QF ø(x,y), if M,N|=T and A≤M and A≤N and a in A and TE b in M st. M|=ø(a,b)
     then there is c in N st. N |= ø(a,c)
then T has QE

proof: the hypothesis tells us that in the setup of the third bullet,
M |= TE y, ø(a,y) iff N|= TE y, ø(a,y)
by the first theorem, TE y, ø(a,y) is equivalent to something QF
by the lemma this is sufficient


def: let L a language, an L-formula ø(x) is universal iff
ø it is equivalent to something of the form FA y1,y2...yn, k(x,y1,...yn) where k is QF

def: let T an theory, universal consequences of T are the theory
T_FA = {ø: ø universal L-sentence and T |= ø}


lemma: M |= T_FA iff N |= T and M≤N

proof tomorrow
