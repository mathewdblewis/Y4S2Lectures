recall: suppose M is an L-struct A≤M
An n-type over A is a set of LA-formulats
∑(x1...xn) in n free vars st. 
∑ is satisfied by an n-tuple in some model of Th(M_A)

lemma: suppose M is an L-structure A≤M, ∑(x)
is a set of LA-formulas, TFAE:
1: ∑(x) is a type over A
2: foral ø1...øk in ∑, Th(MA) |= "TEx, ø1 ^ ... øk"
3: foral ø1...øk in ∑, MA |= "TEx, ø1 ^ ... øk"


proof: 1=>2
by def of type, TE N st. N|=Th(MA)
and b in N st. FA ø in ∑, N|=ø(b)
then FA ø1...øk in ∑, N|= "TEx, ø1^...øk"
since Th(MA) is a complete LA-theory, Th(MA) |= "TEx ø1^...øk"

proof: 2=>3 (trivial)

proof: 3=>1
let d be new constant symbols
let T = Th(M_A) U ∑(d)
if T is consistent, then ∑ is a type
say ∆≤T is finite
say ∆ intersect ∑(d) = {ø1(d)...øk(d)}
by (3) M_A |= "TEx, ø1(x)...øk(x)"
then we can choose a tuple from M to interpret d make MA
to a model of ∆


theorem: suppose M is an L-struct and A≤M and we have a type ∑(x) over A
then there is an el-extension of M in which ∑ is realized

proof: let d be new constants and let T = diag_el(M) U ∑(d)  = Th(Mm) U ∑(d)
let ∆≤T be finite, ∆ intersect ∑(d) = {ø1(d)...øk(d)}
by lemma, Mm can be expanded to a model of ∆


note: suppsoe M≤N and A≤M
then Th(MA) = Th(NA)
so by def of type a type over A (in the sense of M)
is the same as a type over A (in the sense of N)
in particular, S_n^M(A) = S_n^N(A)

cor: suppose M an L-struct, A≤M, p(x1...xn) a set of LA-formulas
then p Sn^M(A) iff TE an L-struct N with M≤N and b1...bn in N st.
p = tp^N(b1...bn,/A)    (recall tp is type)



by the theorem: find N, M≤N,
and b1...bn in N st. b1...bn realizes p
then p≤tp^N(b1...bn/A)



theorem: suppose M is an L-struct, A≤M
a and b tuples of the same length from M
tp^M(a/A) = tp^M(b/A) iff TE an N, M≤N and ø in Aut_A(N) st. ø(a)=b
where Aut_A(N) = Aut(N_A)

proof: (backwards)
tp^M(a/A) = tp^N(a/A)     (by assignment 3)
so foral LA-formula ø(x)
ø in tp^M(a/A) iff ø in tp^N(a/A) iff N_A |= ø(a) iff N_A |= ø(ø(a))
iff N_A |= ø(b) iff ø in tp^N(b/A) iff ø in tp^M(b/A)

the forward direction will be next time




example: let M = (Q,<) and A = Nat = {0,1,...}
let p = tp^M(1/2/A)
notice if r≤0 or 1≤r then r doesn't realize p
say r in (0,1) then  there is some automorphism of Q st. ø(1/2) = r
so r and 1/2 have the same type over A
by QE for this struct, p determined by {0<x,x<1,x<2...}
