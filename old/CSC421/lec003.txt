types of queues: lifo (aka stack), fifo (aka queue), priority (priority queue)


we need a data structure to store data on where we have been as we do
breadth first search or depth first search

admissable heuristic:  underestimates the true cost of an aproach


f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
f is priority queue cost, g is path cost, h is heuristic cost
