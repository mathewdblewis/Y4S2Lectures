we view everything as agents in an environment

he talks about using breadth first search and depth first search



def: a search algorithm is complete iff:
if there is a solution, it will be found eventually

def: a search algorithm is optimal iff:
if there are multiple solution it will find the one with lowest cost

def: time complexity and space complexity
(done in the obvious way)




formulate as search problem: you just tell us the following info:
what is intitial state
what is successor function (takes state and action to state)
what is goal state




hill climbing:
a heuristic search for optimization problem
