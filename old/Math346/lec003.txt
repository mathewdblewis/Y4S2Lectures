Missed first bit of the lecture
from Brandons notes:
def: insolated boundary conditions (BC's):
U(0,t) = Ul(t) and U(L,t) = Ur(t)
perfectly insolated: Ul(t)=Ur(t)=0 foral t
aka no flux BC's (boundary conditions), aka neumann BC's


newtons law of cooling:
warm rod in contant at x=0 wiht moving cool air
heat heaves the rod, heating the air
and carrying away the heat (convection)
air is warmer near the rod
at x=0 we have
k0(0)∂u/∂x(0,t) = -H(u(0,t)-ul(t))

called mixed or robin BC   (boundary conditions)
eg: c1(t)u(0,t) + c2(t)∂u/∂x(0,t) = ul(t)
c2 = 0    (prescribed)
c1 = 0    (insulated)
same for x=L

remark: heat flow changes at a rate proportional to the temperature difference between the rod
and the air


summary: we can mix on left and right at x=0 and x=L between thse conditions
eg: Ut = Uxx + e^(-x^2)
U(x,0) = 1/(x^2+1)
∂U/∂x(0,t) = 0
U(L,t) = sin(t)


periodic boundary conditions:
eg: ∂u/∂x(0,t) = ∂u/∂x(L,t)

equilibrium temperature distribution:
consider ut = k*uxx where k>0 is constant

foral ICs, we should have lim t->∞ u(x,t) existing foral x
he is not claiming or proving this, he is saying this is intuitive
given our understanding of physics

the limit "should be", independent of time


eg: u(0,t) = T1, u(L,t) = T2, T1,T2 in R
general solution of kuxx = 0 is u(x) = c1x+c2,  2 unknowns
u(0,t) = T1 implies u(0) = c2 = T1
u(L,t) = T2 implies u(L) = c1L+c2 = T2
thus c1 = (T2-T1)/L


NOTE: we need two conditions (two perscriptions) because it is second order in space
say we had 5th order in space, we need then 5 boundary space conditions

NOTE: similarly, the number of time derivatives tells you the number of ICs we need in time
for example, we might have the initial state of the system and its initial time derivative

eg: ux(0,t) = 0 and ux(L,t) = 0
recall the general solution is u(x) = c1x+c2
notice both conditions say c1=0
so we don't know the value of c2
however we now know that u(x) = c2
so we don't have a particular solution

he claims the stable solution in this case is a constant function
with value equal to the integral of the initial condition over the entire domain
(this is rather obvious intuitively, but he doesn't prove this)
