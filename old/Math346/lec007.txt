separation of variables:
def: a linear operator L(u) satisfies L(c1u1+c2u2) = c1L(u1) = c2L(u2)
EX: matrices, derivatives etc


properties:
(1)  L(0) = 0
(2)  if L(u) = f and up solves this then so does up+un for any uh satisfying L(uh)
     up = particular solution
     uh = homogeneous solution
     L(u) = f is homogeneous if f=0
     if f ≠ 0 this is inhomogeneous

principle of super position (PSP):
if u1 and u2 are solutions, that is, L(u1)=L(u2)=0 for some linear L, then L(c1u1+c2u2) = 0


thm: the kernel of the 1D laplacian is the affine functions
notice x^2-y^2 is in the kernel of the 2D laplacian
so it gets more complicated in higher dimensions
also in different geometries it also gets harder


example:
ux+u = 0, ∆u = 0, uxxyy-uxyz+ux = 0, a(x)uxx+b(x,y)uyy-u+g(y)uy = 0, ut = grad(K0(x)grad(u))

and the heat operator: ut - grad(K0(x)grad(U)) = 0

not linear: u^2 = 0, ut-uxx+a(x)u*ux = 0
notice the last is equation is non linear because u*ux is quadratic

linearity also applies to boundary conditions
1:  ∂u(0,t)/∂x = 0   (insolated/neuman boundary)
2:  u(0,t) = 0       (pinned)
3:  a1u(0,t)+a2 ux(0,t) = 0

non linear boundary conditions, eg:  u(0,t)ux(0,t) = 0

consider this PDE:
1:   ut = kuxx
2:   u(0,t) = 0 = u(L,t)
it is linear

consider this PDE:
1:   ut = kuxx
2:   u^2(0,t) - ux^2(0,t) = 0
it is non linear



separation of variables:

consider this equation: ut=kuxx, u(0,t) = 0 = u(L,t)
say u = A(x)B(t)
ut = ABt and uxx = Axx B
so we have 0 = A Bt - k Axx B
now divide by kAB
0 = Bt/(kB) - kAxx/A  thus  (Bt/(kB))(t) = k(Axx/A)(x)
notice the right side is a function of x and the left a function of t
thus both sides must be a constant -l   (lambda, a eigenvalue)
it will have a coresponding eigenfunction

so we get these equation:
Axx/A = -l      =>   Axx+lA = 0
Bt/(kB) = -l    =>   Bt+klB = 0

options for l: positive, negative, 0, purely complex
(we rule out the complex case without justification)

recall the boundary conditions: u(0,t) = 0 = u(L,t)
thus A(0)B(t) = 0 = A(L)B(t)
thus A(0) = 0 = A(L)
