he finishes the problem from last time
once you seperate variables its just standard stuff from ODEs

if u(x,0) = f(x) is nice enough, you can write it as a fourier series f(x) = ∑cn*sin(nπx/2)



thm:
∫sin(nπx/L)sin(mπx/L)dx over [0,L] = L/2 for n=m and 0 o.w.
we use this to project a function f onto the basis
