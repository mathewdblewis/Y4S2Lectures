he does a specific example that results in integrating the boundary function against sin(nπx/L)
this gives the values of bn for n in [1,∞)
this is tedious and not enlightening

def: a fucntion is peicewise smooth (on some interval) if the interval can be broken up
into pieces st. in each piece the function is smooth up to the boundary

notice x^(1/3) is not peicewise smooth on any interval containing 0
this is because it is not smooth at 0, that is, f'(0) DNE

given peicewise smooth f on [-L,L], we call the periodic extension of f
the function obtained by continually repeating f with period 2L by translating


fourier series: a0 + ∑an cos(nπx/L) + bn sin(nπx/L)
a0 = 1/(2L) ∫f(x)dx over [-L,L]
an = 1/L ∫f(x)cos(nπx/L)dx over [-L,L]
bn = 1/L ∫f(x)sin(nπx/L)dx over [-L,L]


Fourier's theorem:
If f is peicewise smooth on [-L,L] then the fourier series converges to the periodic extension of f
where the periodic extension is continuous, or to the average of the two limits
(f(x+)+f(x-))/2, where the periodic extension has a jump discontinuety

remark: in general, if f is peicewise smooth we have:
(f(x+)+f(x-))/2 = a0 + ∑an cos(nπx/L) + bn sin(nπx/L)


consider: f(x) = 0 for -L≤x<L/2 and 1 for L/2≤x<L
