def: the odd extension of f(x) defined on 0 to L is given by:
fodd(x) = f(x) for 0≤x≤L and -f(-x) for -L≤x≤0


we call f(x) = ∑bn*sin(nπx/L) the fourier sine series
the sum converges to the periodic extension of the odd extension of f(x)



example:
Find the fourier sine series of f(x)=1 on 0≤x≤L
bn = 2/L ∫sin(nπx/L)dx over [0,L]
= -2/(nπ) [cos(nπx/L)] over [0,L]
= -2/(nπ) [cos(nπ)-1] = 0 for even n and 2/(nπ) for odd n

so we get:
1 = ∑4/((2k+1)π) sin((2k+1)πx/L) over k in [1,∞)
notice this holds only for x in (0,L)
he puts in x=L/2 to get π/4 = 1-1/3+1/5...



Gibbs Phenomenon:
approximate the infinite series with a finite truncation
errors pile up at jump discontinueties
as the number of modes increases the region where it is really far off shrinks (in width)
but don't shrink in height
the jump overshoots by about 9% of the total jump size
