term by term diff of fourier series:
d/dx ∑cngn(x) = cngn'(x)

thm: a con't fourier series can be diffed term by term if f' is peicewise smooth

note: the result of differentiating the fourier cosine series of f is the fourier sine series of f'
recall f(x) need only be continuous for the fourier cosine series to exist and be continuous

example:
x = L/2 - 4L/π^2 ∑1/(2k+1)sin((2k+1)πx/L)
by diffing, we get
1 = x' = 4/π ∑1/(2k+1)sin((2k+1)πx/L)
he claims this holds


thm: if f' is peicewise smooth then the fourier sine series of a cont function f can be
diff term by term if f(0)=f(L)=0

he proves this

thm:
if f' is peicewise smooth then the fourier sine series of a continuous function f
cant be diff term by term
however f'(x) ~ 1/L [f(L)-f(0)] + ∑[nπ/L bn + 2/L(f(L)(-1)^n-f(0))]cos(nπx/L)


example: f(x)=x
f'(x) = 1/L [L-0] + ∑[nπ/L bn + 2/L(L(-1)^n-0)]cos(nπx/L)
= 1 + ∑[nπ/L bn + 2(-1)^n]cos(nπx/L)
he claims the sum component goes to 0
