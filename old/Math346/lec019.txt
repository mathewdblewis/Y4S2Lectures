the wave equation:
perturbed string
vertical displacement y = u(x,t)
newtons law: consider an infinitesemally small segment between x and x+∆x and the mass density
p0(x) is known
total mass ≈ p0(x)∆x

...

we get:

p0(x)utt = T0*uxx + p0(x) Q(x,t)

1d wave equation: if the only body force is gravity, then Q=-g
if its small we can ignore it so we get:

p0(x)utt = T0uxx or eq. utt = c^2 uxx
when you have a uniform string


boundary conditions:
(1) at x=0,L the string is fixed, u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0
or its varied in a particular way: u(x,t) = f(t) and u(L,t)=g(t)
(2) one end of the string is attached to a dynamical system
eg: at x=0 the string is attached to a spring mass system


we can combined these to make more complex systems
