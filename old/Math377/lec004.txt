finishing off brownian model

g(s,t) = kt^3, t≤(s/k)^(1/3) and s otherwise
where s is half the volume

f(s) is the probability distribution for the volume s
this is what we mean by f is a prob dist:   P(a<s<b) = ∫f(s)ds over [a,b]

ø(t) is the fraction crystalized

ø(t) = ∫g(s,t)f(s)ds over [0,∞)

we plug in the definition of g and get this:
ø(t) = ∫sf(s) over [0,kt^3] + kt^3∫f(s)ds over [kt^3,∞)

now we need f(s)
we can find it emperically (looking at crystals)
or we can use a model

emperically we have:
f(s) = bs^d*e^(-ds^2)    (what is d?)

conditions:
∫f(s)ds over [1,∞) = 1      (because it is a pdf)
∫sf(s)ds over [1,∞) = 1     (because as time goes to ∞, we crystalize everything)
(to see this, consider the value for ø(t) at t=∞)
recall f(s) is the amount that the space is crystalized
we have 3 parameters: b,k,d
so we have at this point 1 degree of freedom


numerically plotting ø(t) subject to constraints gives the three parameters
how do we eliminate 1 degree of freedom?
we tune it so that it fits the observed value

lets now find f(s) using a model
we will aproximate the volume of a cell with the volume of the largest sphere inscribed in it



assume poisson distribution of nuclei
pick a nucleus
let X denote distance to its nearest neighbour
P(x<X) = (1-4πx^3/(3V))^(N-1)
prob(X≤x) = 1-(1-4πx^3/(3V))^(N-1)

let S be a volume of the largest sphere in the cell
then S = 4/3π(X/2)^3

prob(S≤s) = prob(4/3π(X/2)^3≤s)
= P(X≤(6s/π)^(1/3))
= 1-e^(-4πl/3*(6s/π))
= 1-e^(-8ls)

he uses this to find a PDF for the distribution
f(s) = 8le^(-8ls)

he puts this f(s) into the formula for ø (this is done in the homework)

the answer we get is ø(t) = 1/(8l)[1-e^(-8lkt^3)]

this is the same as the classical model
we have been unable so far to derive the emperical model





he claims modeling well the shape of the crystals is an open problem



he then talks about dimensional analysis
he does the example where he derives the fact that doubling the speed of a ball thrown upwards
will quadruple its max height
