hint for problem 1:
find E(t), the expected number of waves crossing point p at time t
think about ∆E, that is, number of waves coming from a ring around the point p

fundamental units in physics:
name:                           dimension symbol        SI units
1: mass                         M                       kg
2: length                       L                       m
3: time                         T                       s
4: temperature                  ø                       k
5: current                      I                       A
6: amount                       N                       mol
7: luminosity intensity         J                       cd


we will study a system with variables W1,W2...Wn
and a value we are interested in u
so we have: {u,W1,...Wn}



Notice force is not a fundamental unit in this system
we can express it in terms of the other units

assume all of the parameters can be written as products of powers of the fundamental units
(he doesn't justifty this)


how to do dimensional analysis:
1: write down each paramter in terms of fundamental units
2: decide how many fundamental units used
3: goal: write u as a function of the w's, that is: u = f(w1,w2...wn)
4: u = f(p1...pm,s1...s(n-m))

we divide the parameters into primary and secondary parameters


example: P1=force, P2=time,P3=L
notice M = [P1*P3^2/P2], so we can get mass


he explains how to express the dimension as a vector (just log it)



the primaries must be linearly independent

plan: write u (or s1,...s(n-m)) in terms of P1,...Pm
u = f(p1,...pm,D1π1...D(n-m)π(n-m))
let D be the units of u
then we have:
u/D = 1/D f(p1,...pm,D1π1...D(n-m)π(n-m))

big idea: a dimensionless equation can't depend on the choice of scaling the units
as a consequence, u/D depends only on f(D1π1,...D(n-m)π(n-m))





example: trinity bomb:
r = f(t,E,p0,P0)   (t time, E energy, p0 air density, P0 pressure, r radius)
[r] = L, [t] = T, [E] = ML^2/T^2

choose these as primaries: t,E,p0
pick this order for dimension: t,L,M   (mass length time)
[r] = t^a*E^b*p0^c
this gives this matrix problem:
[0;1;0] = [0  1  1] [a]
          [0  2 -3] [b]
          [1 -2  0] [c]

so we solve this for [a,b,c] and then were good
solving this gives [a,b,c] = [2/5,1/5,-1/5]

this gives:
[r] = [t^2E/p0]^(1/5) = D

we do the same with pressure P0:
[1 -1 -2] = [0  1  1] [a]
            [0  2 -3] [b]
            [1 -2  0] [c]

he gets: [P0] = (E^2p0^3/t^6)^(1/5)

so we have:
r = [t^2E/p0]^(1/5) * f(P0*(E^2p0^3/t^6)^(-1/5))


he reasons P0*(E^2p0^3/t^6)^(-1/5) is close to 0
because E is big and time is small

he therefor simplifies f(...) as a constant f(0)

he found that f(0) = 1 experimentally
