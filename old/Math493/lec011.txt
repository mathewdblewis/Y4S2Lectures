new assignment on Friday or possibly Tuesday





recall we are working on up and downward lowelheim skolem
recall this is a just a generalization of the group theory example
if you have structures of arbitrarily large size, you can do so to arbitrary cardinality

M an L-structure: Lm = L U {cm| m in M}
diag(M) = {ø: ø is an atomic or negated atomic Lm-sentence and Mm |= ø}
diag_(el)(M) = {ø: ø is an L-sentence, Mm|=ø}
(el stands for elementary)

lemma: suppose N an Lm-structure
if N models diag(M), then the function a:M->N defined by a(m) = cm^N
is an embedding of M into N|L
also if N|=diag(el)(M) then the map a:M->N defined above is an elementary embedding

we won't prove the lemma, but its straightforward (look at assignment 1)


thm: upward lowenheim skolem (version 1)
suppose M an infinite L-structure and k≥max{|M|,|L|}
then there is an L-structure N st. M<<N and |N|≥k      (recall << is elementary substructure)


proof: let I be a set of size k, for each i in I, let di be a new constant symbol
let T = diag_(el)(M) U {di ≠ dj| i≠j}
if T is consistent, we can take N to be a model of T
so we only need to look at finite subsets and show they are consistent

any finite subset of T is satisfied in an expansion of Mm to include interpretations


now the downward direction


thm: (tarski vaught)
suppose M and N are L-structures and M≤N, then M<<N
foral formulas ø(v,w), and all a in M, if there is b in N st. N |= ø(b,a)
then there is b' in M st. M |= ø(b',a)

proof: the forward direction is true trivially
backwards: do induction on formulas
all cases of the induction work except existential quantification
the last step is to use the hypothesis about existential quanification


example: M = ([0,1],≤) and N = ([0,2],≤) and ø := "not (x≤y)"
then N models TE x, ø(x,1) yet this is false in M


def: let L a language, T an L-theory
we say T has built in skolem functions if FA L-formulas ø(v,w1...wn)
TE. n-ary function symbol f_ø in L st.
T |= "FA w1...wn (TE v, ø(v,w1...wn) -> ø(fø(w1...wn),w1...wn))
so f "picks" the witness for the existential
if the quantification is not true, f can do whatever it likes


lemma: let T an L-theory, there is language L*≥L and L*-theory T*≥T st.
T* has built-in skolem functions and every model of T can be expanded into a
model of T* by interpreting symbosl in L*-L
we can make |L*| = max{|L|,|N|}
T* is called a skolemization of T

proof: let L0 = L and T0 = T
we construct Li and Ti recursively
L(i+1) = Li U {fø: ø is an Li formula}
note: |L(i+1)| = max{|Li|,|N|}
T(i+1) = Ti U {foral w(TE v ø(v,w) implies ø(fø(w),w)): ø is an Li-formula}
let L* = U{Li} and T* = U{Ti}

notice any L* formula is in some Li, so at stage (i+1) the skolem function is made for it
