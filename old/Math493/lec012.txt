finishing from last time:
recall built in skolem function
foral ø(v,w), there is symbol fø st. T|=foral w, ø(v,w)
suppose M|=T, we want to expand M to be a model of T*
let M0 = M
define L(i+1) structure M(i+1) expand Mi as follows

pick an arbtrary z in M (the default value)
cosndier an Li-formula ø(v,w) and a tuple a in M
if Mi |= "TE v ø(v,a)", then let b in M be st. Mi |= ø(b,a) and define fø^M(i+1)(a) = b
otherwise define fø(a) = z

then M(i+1) |= "FA w, TE v, ø(v,w) -> ø(fø(w),w))"
so M(i+1) |= T(i+1)

let M* be the L* expansion of M obtained at the end of this process, then M* |= T*


theorem: (downard lowneheim skolem)
suppose M is an L-structure and X≤M
then there is an N st. N<<M, X≤N, |N|≤max{|X|,|L|,|Naturals|}

proof:
wlog thm(M) has built-in skolem functions
let X0 = X U {c^M: c is a constant symbol}
X(i+1) = Xi U {f^M(a): a in Xi and f is a function symbol}
let N = U Xi over all i in [0,1,...]

from here it is clear that |N|≤max{|X|,|L|,|nat|}

define c^N = c^M foral constants
R^N = R^M intersect N^K for each k-ary relation R
f^N = f^M|N^k for each k-ary function f
by construction f^N|N^k:N^k -> N
then N≤M

to check that N<<M, we use tarski vaught test



theorem: upward LS (lowenheim skolem)
suppose M is an L-structure and k≥max{|M|,|L|,|Nat|} then there is N st. M<<N and |N|=k

proof:
first by weak upward LS get N' st. M≤N' and |N|≤k
let X≤N' be st. M≤X and |X|=k
by downward LS get N≤N' st. X≤N and |N|≤K so |N|=k




in the text, we just finished section 2.3 and now will do section 2.2


def: let T an L-theory and k a cardinal
define I(T,k) to be the number of isomorphism classes of T of size k


def: T is called k-catagorical iff I(t,k) = 1


examples: let L=ø and T=T∞
recall T∞ is the collection of statements
"there are 2 different things, there are 3 different things ... "
T is k catagorical for all infinite k
because an L-isomorphism here is just a bijection

example: L={≤} and T=DLO (dense linear orders without endpoints)
cantor proved (see section 2.4 of text) that if M|=T and M is countable then M~(Q,<)
so DLO is countably catagorical

on the other hand if k is uncountable, then you have I(T,k) = 2^k
