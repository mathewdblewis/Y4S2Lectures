recall: let ø be an Lrng sentence, TFAE:
(1)  C |= ø
(2)  cls(Fp) |= ø foral but finitely many p
(3)  cls(Fp) |= ø for arbitrarily large p


we will prove the following theorem (Ax-Grothendieck):
all injective polynomial maps f:C^n->C^n is surjective

fact: let A≤cls(Fp) be finite (p≠0), then the subfield of cls(Fp) generated by A is finite
proof: cls(Fp) = U F_(p^n)
so if you have a finite set you start with to generate the new field you get a finite subfield
in words, this means the field is locally finite


def: a polymap is a function f:K^n->K^n st. f=(f1...fn) where each fi in K[x1...xn]

lemma: suppose K a finite field, if f:K^n->K^n injective, then it is surjective
proof: trivial

lemma: if f:cls(Fp)^n->cls(Fp)^n a polymap then injective implies surjective
proof: suppose not, then we have an injective polymap f that is not surjective
there are finitely many cofficients used in the definition of f
let A≤cls(Fp) be the set of these cofficients
let B≤cls(Fp) be finite st. there is some tuple b=(b1...bn) in B st. b not in img(f)
now let the field K≤cls(Fp) be the field generated by A U B
this is a finite field (by a previous lemma)
because A≤K, f restricts to a polymap f|_k:K^n->K^n
however this map must be surjective by the previous lemma which is a contradiction


proof of ax-grothendieck
suppose f:C^n->C^n is an injective polymap, then f is surjective
there is an L-ring sentence ø_(n,k) that expresses the following:
if f:M^n->M^n is a polymap with components of max degree k
then if f is injective then f is surjective
to quantify over all polymaps, we quantify over the coefficients

since cls(Fp) |= ø(n,k) foral n,k,p by lefschetz, C |= ø(n,k) foral k






chapter 3: quantifier elimination

def: let L be a language, an L-formula ø is quantifier free if it has no "TE" or "FA" in it
idea: formulas with lots of quantifiers are hard to deal with at times




example: let N = (Nat,+,*,0,1,<)
if ø(x) is quant free, what can it do?
it expresses a boolean combination of equalities and inequalities
of polynomials in x with coefficients in Nat

fact: if ø is allowed to have the form "TE y1..yn, k(y1,,,yn,x)"
where k is quantfree, then any computably enumerable subset of N can be defined by such a ø



sometimes we get lucky and formulas with quantifiers are equivalent to quantfree formulas
eg: consider R=(R,+,-,*,0,1)
let ø(a0,a1,a2) be the formula "TE x, a2x^2+a1x+a0=0"
let k(a0,a1,a2) be the formula "(a1^2-4a2a0≥0 and a2≠0) or (a2=0 and (a1≠0 or a0=0))"
then R |= "foral a0,a1,a2 (ø(a) iff k(a))"
notice we need a different formula k when we are in C



next time will determine when we can get rid of quants
