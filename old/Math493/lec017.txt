recall T_FA = {ø:ø is a universal sentence and T|=ø}

lemma: M|=TFA iff TE N, N|=T and M≤N
proof: (backwards)
suppose M≤N and ø in T_FA

say ø is "FA x ø(x)" where ø is QF then N|=ø so foral a in N, N|=ø(a)
in particular foral a in M, N|=ø(a) sine ø is QF foral a in M, M|=ø(a), so M|=ø

proof: (fowards)
suppose M |= T_FA
let ∑=diag(M)UT
if N|=∑ then N|=T and M≤N
so we only need to show ∑ is consistent


suppose ∆≤∑, ∆ finite
we may assume ∆ = T U {ø(cm1,...cmn)}
for some L-formula ø(x1...xm)
importantly, ø is QF
then Mm |= ø(cm1...cmn) since Mm |= diag(M)
thus M |= "TEx, ø(x)"
thus M |!= "FAx, not ø(x)"
since M|=T_FA and "FAx, not ø(x)" is a universal sentence
this means that "FAx, not ø(x)" is not in T_FA
thus T|!="FAx, not ø(x)"
thus TE N0|=T st. N0!|="FAx, not ø(x)"
so N0|="TEx,ø(x)"
interpret cm1...cmn in N0 as a witness to this and we get a model of
T U {ø(cm1,...cmn)}


def: let L be a language and T an L-theory
T has algebraically prime models iff:
FA A|=T_FA, TE M, M|=T, i:A->M  (i an embedding)
FA N|=T, j:A->N
j extends to jhat:M->N

in english, we can put A inside M so that for any way of putting A in N
we can get a map from M to N
M is the "smallest" model of T containing A as a substructure


example: ACF0
ACF0 has algebracially prime models
proof: suppose A|=ACF0_FA, so A is an integeral domain let M = cls(frac(A))
then M is the algebraically prime model over A



def: suppose M,N|=T and M≤N
we say M is simply closed in N, denoted M <_s N iff FA QF L-formulas ø(x,y)
and FA a in M, if N|="TEy,ø(a,y)" then M|="TEy,ø(a,y)"

this is a weak version of elementary substructure

example: suppose M,N |= ACF and M≤N, then M<_s N
proof: suppose ø(x,y) if QF, a in M and N|=ø(a,b)
must show M|=ø(a,c) for some c in M
we can assume ø is in DNF (disjunctive normal form)
so ø is V((& ai) & (& not bj))
in fact, since N|=ø(a,b), N models one of the disjuncts
so we can assume ø(x,y) = (& ai(x,y)) & (& not bj(x,y))
with each ai and bj atomic

what are the atomics in L_rng? they are just polynomials equated to 0
polynomials come from Z[x,y]
we get Z because we can add things to themselves any finite number of times

when we plug in elements of M for the x's
we get single-variate polynomials with coefs in M
thus ø(a,y) is of the form ((& pi(y)=0) & (& qj(y)≠0))
for some pi,qj in M[y]

if any pi's appear in ø then pi(b)=0
thus b in N is algebraic over M, since M is alg closed b is in M

we still must consider what happens when ø(a,y) only has negated litterals
so we have ø(a,y) = "& qj(y) ≠ 0"
notice "& qj(y) ≠ 0" excludes only finitely many elements
because each qj has finitely many roots and there are finitely many qj's
also ACFp always has infinitely many elements, thus this can be satisfied
by some c in M st. FA j, qj(c)≠0
notice because this worked in N this rules out the case where qj is the 0 polynomial
