recall K is an alg closed field
I≤K[x1...xn] is a radical ideal if I is an ideal and foral f in K[x] foral n in N
f^n in I implies f in I
for X≤K^n I(S) = {f in K[x]: foral a in X, f(a)=0}
for S≤K[x], V(S) = {a in K^n: foral f in S, f(a)=0}
X≤K^n is zarski-closed if TE S, X=V(S)


theorem: (nullstellenzatz)
the map X->I(X) is a bijection between zariski closed subsets of K^n
and radical ideals in K[x1...xn] with inverse J->V(J)


facts from algebra:
every ideal in K[x1...xn] is finitely generated (hilbert's basis theorem)
if J'≤J are ideals in K[x1...xn] and x in J-J', then TE prime ideal P st. J'≤P
and x not in P


proof of nullstellensatz:
first, suppose X is zariski closed, we show X=V(I(X))
suppose a in X, then for any f in I(x), f(a)=0
thus a in V(I(X)) because then at a, any f vanishes, thus X≤V(I(X))

say a in V(I(X)), let S≤K[x1...xn]] be st. X=V(S)
if a not in X, then a not in V(S)
so there is some f in S st. f(a)≠0
but S≤I(V(S)), thus f in I(V(S))
thus a not in V(I(V(S))) = V(I(X)), contradiction, so a in X


suppose J is a radical ideal in K[X], we must show J=I(V(J))
by chasing definitions, J≤I(V(J))

claim: suppose J' a radical ideal and J'<J then V(J)<V(J')
(we prove this later)

suppose we prove the claim
If J≠I(V(J)) then J<I(V(J))
by the claim V(I(V(J)))<V(J)
by the first part of the proof we have V(J)=V(I(V(J)))<V(J)
however V(J)<V(J) is false, thus J≠I(V(J)) is false and thus J=I(V(J))



so we now prove the claim   (J'<J then V(J)<V(J'))
by definition, if J'≤J then V(J)≤V(J') so it is sufficient to show inequality
pick f in J-J'
let P be a prime ideal in K[x] st. J'≤P and f not in P   (by the fact stated before)
if we find b in V(P) st. f(b)≠0 then also b in V(J') and b not in V(J)

let F = cls(frac(K[x]/P))
then K≤F (upto isomorphism) and K|=ACF and F|=ACF
then K≤≤F (K is an elementary substructure of F) because ACF is model complete

let q1...qm be generators for J' in K[x]
let ai in F be the image of xi
then since each qi in P, qi(a)=0
since f not in P, f(a)≠0
F |= "TE w, q1(w)=0 & ... qm(w)=0 & f(w)≠0"

since the expresion is an Lk-sentence, K≤F
we have K|="TE w, q1(w)=0 & ... qm(w)=0 & f(w)≠0"

Let b in K^n be a witness to this, then qi(b)=0 so b in V(P), but f(b)≠0




def: let J≤K[x] be an ideal, the radical of J denoted √J = {f in K[x]: TE n, f^n in J}
one can check that V(J) = V(√J) = V(I(V(J)))
thus by nullstellensatz, √J = I(V(J)))


cor: suppose p1(x)...pm(x) in K[x] then if <p1(x)...pm(x)> ≠ K[x] then TE b in K^n st.
p1(b)=...pm(b)=0

prf:
suppose there is no common zero, let J = <p1...pm>, then V(J)=ø, then I(V(J)) = K[x]
then 1 in I(V(J)) = √J, so TE n, 1^n in J so 1 in J
